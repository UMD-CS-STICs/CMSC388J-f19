# Week 4
### Databases and SQL Injections

The slides for this week are linked on Piazza. 

The code in this directory is what we created in class, plus possibly some
more detail or fixes. This README contains a detailed description of everything.

To run all of the code, make sure to `pip install Flask flask-sqlalchemy`

Optionally, `pip install python-dotenv`
