# Week 8
### Blueprints

This week we'll look at an app where a user can register/login to our website 
and see all of the posts they've created, as well as look at other user's posts.

The database we provide already has some users and posts in there. The users are:


| Username        | Email           | Password  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| harrypotter      | harry@hogw.edu | VoldemortSucks |
| gvanrossum     | guido@python.org     |   ilovepython3.8.0 |
