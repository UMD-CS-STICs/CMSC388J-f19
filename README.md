# Building Secure Web Applications with Python and Flask

![Flask Logo][logo]

This course is an introduction to building secure, full-stack web applications with Python and Flask.
We'll start with Python and Flask and transition to web application security, where we'll look at
different types of security vulnerabilities and best practices to patch up these vulnerabilities in your own apps.
Then, we'll go to building your own API and securely authenticating with it, and finish by showing you how you
can deploy your web app!

## Grading

Grades will be maintained on (ELMS/department grade server/etc).
You will be responsible for all material discussed in lecture as well as other standard means of communication
(Piazza, email announcements, etc.), including but not limited to deadlines, policies, assignment changes, etc.

Grades will be maintained on the CS Department [grades server](https://grades.cs.umd.edu/).

You will be responsible for all material discussed in lecture as well as
all other standard means of communication (Piazza, ELMS announcements), including but not
limited to deadlines, policies, assignment changes, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
percentages:

| Percentage | Title         | Description                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 45%        | Projects      | Weekly projects to apply lecture material and make practical applications.                                               |
| 20%        | Midterm       | Examination                                                                                                              |
| 30%        | Final Project | Final project to demonstrate mastery of all topics learned and apply knowledge to create a new application from scratch. |
| 5%        | Survey Participation | Weekly anonymous feedback surveys

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted
within one week of when it is returned. No requests will be considered
afterwards.

## Projects

The project is due the day it is scheduled to be due, barring any extensions that may be given out. They will be due at 11:59 PM. Not all of
the projects will have tests; they will be graded according to a rubric which will also be provided. All projects must be submitted online at
the [submit server](https://submit.cs.umd.edu/).

Project 1 will be worth 9% of your final grade. 
The other projects (excluding the final) will be worth 12% each of your final grade.

**Late Policy**: Projects may be submitted up to one day late for 10% off your earned grade. After this, no more projects will be accepted.
The highest score you get on the project, counting late and on-time submissions, will be your grade for that project. There are **no exceptions**
unless you've talked with us beforehand or provide a valid excuse.

We will look at your most recent on-time and late (if applicable) submissions when grading.

Every project will have approximately 10% of the project grade reserved for style: proper formatting and commenting.

## Midterm

The midterm will test your knowledge of Python, Flask, and all security topics we discussed prior.

There will be conceptual questions on Python, Flask, and web application security. There will be 1-2 Python/Flask coding questions,
and the rest will be fill-in-the-blank or short response questions on Python, Flask, and security.

All material discussed in lectures before the midterm will be tested.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We'll communicate through students mainly through Piazza and through office hours.

**Office hours**: Wednesday 1 - 2 PM @ AVW 1120, or by appointment

Email should only be used for emergencies, please use Piazza, otherwise. We'll get back to you more quickly on Piazza.

## Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations
See the section titled "Attendance, Absences, or Missed Assignments" available at
[Course Related Policies](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).

## Disability Support Accommodations
See the section titled "Accessibility" available at
[Course Related Policies](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and
plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic
dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all
submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to
the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
[Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of
Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
http://www.shc.umd.edu.

# Course Evaluations
If you have a suggestion for improving this class, don't hesitate to tell the
instructor or TAs during the semester. At the end of the semester, please don't
forget to provide your feedback using the campus-wide CourseEvalUM system. Your
comments will help make this class better.
